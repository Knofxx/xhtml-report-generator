- #highlight and #highlight_captures now support html color codes as color input
- added following new methods
  - custom_table  (allows for customized attributes per cell / ranges and interpretation of table_data as html instead of text only)
- added following additional methods, which instead of inserting something into the report just return the html code
  as a string (in order to be used with the #custom_table method above, e.g. to construct table based layouts)
  - get_code_html
  - get_content_html
  - get_link_html
